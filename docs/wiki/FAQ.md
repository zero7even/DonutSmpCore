# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) & Troubleshooting

This page provides answers and troubleshooting steps for common questions, configuration issues, and error resolutions when running **UltimateDonutSMP**.

---

## 1. PlaceholderAPI & Placeholders Troubleshooting

### Question: Why are my `%economy_*%` placeholders showing as unparsed raw text (e.g. `%economy_money%`) or blank in scoreboards, chat, tablists, or DeluxeMenus?

#### Root Causes & Solutions:

1. **PlaceholderAPI is not installed**:
   - **Fix**: UltimateDonutSMP requires the **PlaceholderAPI** plugin to parse `%economy_*%` tags. Download and place `PlaceholderAPI.jar` into your server's `plugins/` folder and restart the server.

2. **UltimateDonutSMP started before PlaceholderAPI**:
   - **Fix**: Place `PlaceholderAPI.jar` in the `plugins/` directory and ensure soft dependencies load correctly. Run `/uds reload` or restart the server to trigger the expansion registration.

3. **Typo in Placeholder Identifier**:
   - **Fix**: UltimateDonutSMP uses `%economy_*%` as its identifier prefix.
     - Correct: `%economy_money%`, `%economy_shards%`, `%economy_team%`
     - Incorrect: `%ultimatedonutsmp_money%`, `%uds_money%`

4. **Player is Offline or Context Missing**:
   - **Fix**: Placeholders like `%economy_ping%`, `%economy_shard_cuboid_status%`, or `%economy_shard_cuboid_display%` require an active online player session. When called from console or headless holograms without player context, they return default fallback values (`0`, `outside`, `-`).

5. **Display plugin does not support PlaceholderAPI**:
   - **Fix**: Verify that your scoreboard, tablist, chat formatting, or hologram plugin has PlaceholderAPI integration enabled in its configuration.

## 2. Vault & Economy Integration

### Question: Why are third-party plugins (like ChestShop, CMI, or ShopGUIPlus) not detecting player money balances?

#### Solutions:
- **Install Vault**: UltimateDonutSMP registers itself as a Vault Economy provider on startup. Ensure `Vault.jar` is installed in your `plugins/` folder.
- **Check Startup Logs**: Look for `[UltimateDonutSMP] Vault economy provider registered successfully` in server startup logs.
- **Remove Conflicting Economy Plugins**: Remove plugins like EssentialsX Economy or Reserve that might override the Vault economy registration.

---

## 3. Database & Storage Issues

### Question: Why is player money, shards, or home data resetting after a server restart?

#### Solutions:
- **SQLite File Permissions**: If using SQLite (default), ensure the server process has read/write permissions for `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/database.db`.
- **MySQL / MongoDB Credentials**: If using MySQL or MongoDB (`database.yml`), check that your database host, port, username, and password are correct and that the database server allows remote connections.
- **Check Console Logs**: Check for SQL connection timeouts or pool exhaustion errors on startup.

---

## 4. Cuboids & Portals Troubleshooting

### Question: Why is `/portal` not teleporting players or `/cuboid bind` not giving AFK/Shard rewards?

#### Solutions:
- **Verify Region Bounds**: Use `/cuboid list` to ensure the target cuboid region exists and spans the correct coordinates.
- **Check Binding Status**: For AFK or Shard zones, run:
  ```bash
  /cuboid bind <cuboid_name> spawn true
  /cuboid bind <cuboid_name> shard true
  ```
- **Set Warp / Spawn Locations**: If a portal has destination type `WARP`, ensure the specified warp name exists (`/warp`).

---

## 5. Spawners & Silk Touch

### Question: Why do custom spawners break into default pig spawners or fail to drop when mined?

#### Solutions:
- **Silk Touch Requirement**: By default, breaking spawners requires a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch. Only Creative mode and the `ultimatedonutsmp.spawner.bypass` permission are exempt. Operators are **not** exempt: that node is registered with `default: false` and must be assigned explicitly via LuckPerms.
- **Check `spawners.yml`**: Ensure `SETTINGS.REQUIRE_SILK_TOUCH: true/false` is configured according to your server rules.

---

## 6. Staff Mode & Vanish

### Question: Why can players still see vanished staff members in tablist or game?

#### Solutions:
- **Install ProtocolLib**: UltimateDonutSMP uses **ProtocolLib** for packet-level vanish suppression, chest animation silencing, and equipment hiding. Install `ProtocolLib.jar` for full vanish protection.
- **Check Staff Permissions**: Ensure normal players do not have see-vanish permissions (`ultimatedonutsmp.admin.vanish.see`).

---

## 7. Duels & Fast Crystals

### Question: Why are End Crystals placing at normal vanilla speed during duels?

#### Solutions:
- Check `duels.yml` and ensure `FAST-CRYSTAL.ENABLED: true` and `PLACEMENT-DELAY-TICKS: 0`.
- Verify that ProtocolLib is active to handle zero-tick crystal packet processing.

---

## 8. Player Ranks, Plus (+), and Media Privileges

### Question: How do I give Plus (+), Media, Streamer, or Donut+ ranks and privileges to a player?

#### 1. Assigning Rank Groups via LuckPerms
To assign a permanent or temporary rank group to a player using **LuckPerms**:
- **Permanent Rank**:
  ```bash
  /lp user <player> parent add <group_name>
  ```
  *Example*: `/lp user Steve parent add plus` or `/lp user Steve parent add media`
- **Temporary Rank (e.g. 30 Days)**:
  ```bash
  /lp user <player> parent addtemp <group_name> 30d
  ```

#### 2. Configuring Prefix Tags (Chat & Tablist)
Set custom rank prefixes for the `+` or `MEDIA` rank groups in LuckPerms:
```bash
/lp group plus meta setprefix 100 "&d[DONUT+] "
/lp group media meta setprefix 100 "&c[MEDIA] "
```

#### 3. Granting UltimateDonutSMP Rank Perks
Attach specific UltimateDonutSMP permission nodes to your `plus` or `media` groups:
- **Expanded Home Limits**: `ultimatedonutsmp.command.sethome.multiple.<amount>`
- **Ender Chest Row Expansion**: `ultimatedonutsmp.enderchest.rows.<1-6>`
- **RTP Cooldown Bypass**: `ultimatedonutsmp.command.rtp.bypasscooldown`
- **Key Giveaways & Rewards**:
  - Give Crate Keys: `/crate key <player> <crate_name> <amount>`
  - KeyAll Broadcast: `/crate keyall <crate_name> <amount>`
  - Server Multiplier Booster: `/booster give <player> <money|shards> <multiplier> <seconds>`

## 9. Transferring & Importing Player Homes (Home Import / Export)

### Question: How do I transfer or import player homes from an old server or database to a new one?

#### Option 1: Direct SQLite File Copy (Same Plugin Instance)
If you are moving your server to a new host or updating server files:
1. Stop both old and new Minecraft servers.
2. Copy `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/database.db` from your old server folder to `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/database.db` on your new server.
3. Start the new server. All player homes, balances, and statistics will be loaded automatically.

#### Option 2: MySQL / MongoDB Migration
If migrating from SQLite to MySQL or between database instances:
1. Configure connection credentials in `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/database.yml`.
2. Export the `homes` table from your old database.
3. Import the SQL table structure:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS homes (
       player_uuid VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
       home_name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
       world VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
       x DOUBLE NOT NULL,
       y DOUBLE NOT NULL,
       z DOUBLE NOT NULL,
       yaw FLOAT NOT NULL,
       pitch FLOAT NOT NULL,
       created_at BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
       PRIMARY KEY (player_uuid, home_name)
   );
   ```
4. Insert your home records:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO homes (player_uuid, home_name, world, x, y, z, yaw, pitch, created_at)
   VALUES ('player-uuid-here', 'home_name', 'world', 100.5, 64.0, -200.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1600000000);
   ```

#### Option 3: Importing Legacy Homes from EssentialsX
If migrating from EssentialsX to UltimateDonutSMP:
- EssentialsX stores player homes inside `plugins/Essentials/userdata/<uuid>.yml` under the `homes:` key.
- You can parse the YAML coordinates from Essentials userdata files and insert them into the `homes` SQL table using a standard SQL script or database utility (such as DB Browser for SQLite).

## 10. Shard Anti-AFK & Disabling "Move to keep earning shards" (`MIN-MOVEMENT-BLOCKS`)

### Question: Why do players see "Move to keep earning shards (0/5)" and how do I disable the movement requirement?

#### Explanation:
By default, UltimateDonutSMP enforces anti-AFK movement checks inside Shard Cuboids (or Everywhere Shards) so that players cannot earn free passive Shards by standing completely still or macroing without moving.

#### How to Disable the Movement Requirement Completely:
If you want players to earn Shards passively while standing completely still inside Shard Cuboids (or anywhere on the server):

1. Open `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/config.yml`.
2. Locate the `SHARDS` section under `CUBOIDS` or `EVERYWHERE`.
3. Change `MIN-MOVEMENT-BLOCKS` from `5` to `0`:

```yaml
SHARDS:
  CUBOIDS:
    REGIONS:
      spawn:
        # Set to 0 to allow passive AFK shard earning without moving
        MIN-MOVEMENT-BLOCKS: 0
        RECENT-MOVEMENT-WINDOW: 15
```

4. Save `config.yml` and run `/uds reload` in-game or from console.

## 11. Enabling Global Server-Wide Death Messages (`death-messages.yml`)

### Question: Why are death messages only showing to nearby players, and how do I turn on global death messages server-wide?

#### Explanation:
By default, UltimateDonutSMP limits death messages to nearby players within a chunk radius (`RADIUS: true`, `CHUNKS: 5`) to reduce chat spam in crowded areas or spawn arenas.

#### How to Enable Global Death Messages:
To make all death messages broadcast globally across the entire server to every online player:

1. Open `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/death-messages.yml`.
2. Locate the `SETTINGS` block at the top of the file:

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  # Set RADIUS to false to disable distance limits and broadcast death messages globally
  RADIUS: false
  CHUNKS: 5

MESSAGES:
  ENABLED: true
  PREFIX: '&c☠ '
```

3. Ensure `MESSAGES.ENABLED` is set to `true`.
4. Save `death-messages.yml` and run `/uds reload` in-game or from console.

## 12. Clarification on `/uds setup setspawn` vs Player Death Respawn

### Question: Does `/uds setup setspawn` set where players respawn when they die?

#### Clarification & Actual Purpose:
- **No**. `/uds setup setspawn` (or `/setspawn`) does **NOT** set an individual player's death respawn point.
- **Actual Purpose**: It is an administrator setup command used to set the **Global Server Spawn Hub Location** (e.g., Central Marketplace, Server Shop Hub, or Spawn Arena). This is the location where players are sent when executing `/spawn` or walking through Portal triggers (`/portal`).
- **Player Death Respawn**: Player death respawn locations are governed by vanilla Minecraft **Beds**, **Respawn Anchors**, or player homes (`/sethome`).

---

## 13. LuckPerms & LuckPermsChat (LPC) Integration & Tablist Displays

### Question: I use LuckPerms and LuckPermsChat (LPC) for my own rank system. Does UltimateDonutSMP override my chat format or tablist display, and is it visible to other players?

#### Explanation:
UltimateDonutSMP includes its own built-in chat formatting engine and tablist manager, which read player rank prefixes and suffixes from **LuckPerms** via Vault or PlaceholderAPI. Depending on your configuration, UltimateDonutSMP can either format chat for you or step aside to let **LuckPermsChat (LPC)**, **EssentialsChat**, or **TAB** manage your chat and tablist display for all players.

#### How to Prevent Overrides & Configure Your Rank System:

1. **If you want LuckPermsChat (LPC) or EssentialsChat to handle chat formatting**:
   - Disable UltimateDonutSMP's chat formatting in `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/config.yml`:
     ```yaml
     CHAT:
       FORMAT-ENABLED: false  # Set to false to allow LPC / EssentialsChat to handle chat
     ```
   - Run `/uds reload`. Now your LuckPermsChat format will be 100% active without any overrides or double-prefixing.

2. **If you want UltimateDonutSMP to handle chat formatting with LuckPerms ranks**:
   - Keep `CHAT.FORMAT-ENABLED: true` in `config.yml`.
   - Configure the chat format string to include the LuckPerms prefix tag:
     ```yaml
     CHAT:
       FORMAT: '&f%luckperms_prefix%%player%&7: &f%message%'
     ```
   - All online players will see your LuckPerms rank prefix in global chat.

3. **Configuring Rank Displays in Tablist**:
   - If using UltimateDonutSMP's built-in tablist (`scoreboard.yml`), set player prefixes using PlaceholderAPI:
     ```yaml
     TABLIST:
       ENABLED: true
       HEADER:
         - '&e&lYOUR SERVER NAME'
       FOOTER:
         - '&7Rank: %luckperms_prefix%'
     ```
   - If using a third-party tablist plugin (e.g. **TAB by NEYNAM**), disable UltimateDonutSMP's tablist in `scoreboard.yml` by setting `TABLIST.ENABLED: false` so it does not conflict with your custom tablist display.

## 14. Adding Splash Potions of Strength & Mixed Potions to `/shop` (`shop.yml`)

### Question: How do I add a Splash Potion of Strength to `/shop`, and can I create mixed potions with multiple effects (e.g., Fire Resistance + Strength + Speed)?

#### Explanation:
In UltimateDonutSMP's `shop.yml`, you can add custom potion items to any shop category (e.g., `GEAR-MENU` or a dedicated `POTION-MENU`).

There are two primary methods to set up potions in `/shop`:
1. **Method 1 (Recommended for Custom & Mixed Potions)**: Using the `COMMAND:` property to execute a vanilla `/give` command with custom potion component NBT data when purchased. This allows unlimited mixing of effects (Strength, Speed, Fire Resistance, Haste, etc.), custom amplifiers, and custom durations.
2. **Method 2 (Standard Vanilla Potions)**: Using `MATERIAL: SPLASH_POTION` combined with `POTION_TYPE`.

---

#### Method 1: Custom & Mixed Potions via Console Command (`COMMAND:`)

To add a **Splash Potion of Strength II**:
```yaml
POTION-STRENGTH-2:
  CURRENCY: MONEY
  MATERIAL: SPLASH_POTION
  DISPLAY-NAME: '&c&lSplash Potion of Strength II'
  SLOT: 10
  PRICE-PER-UNIT: 500.0
  COMMAND: 'minecraft:give {player} splash_potion[potion_contents={custom_effects:[{id:"strength",amplifier:1,duration:1800}]}] 1'
  LORE:
    - '&fBuy price: &a$500'
    - '&7Effect:'
    - ' &c• Strength II (1:30)'
```

To add a **Mixed Multi-Effect Potion** (Strength II + Speed II + Fire Resistance):
```yaml
SUPER-BUFF-POTION:
  CURRENCY: MONEY
  MATERIAL: SPLASH_POTION
  DISPLAY-NAME: '&e&lSuper Battle Elixir (Mixed Potion)'
  SLOT: 11
  PRICE-PER-UNIT: 2500.0
  COMMAND: 'minecraft:give {player} splash_potion[potion_contents={custom_effects:[{id:"strength",amplifier:1,duration:1800},{id:"speed",amplifier:1,duration:3600},{id:"fire_resistance",amplifier:0,duration:6000}]}] 1'
  LORE:
    - '&fBuy price: &a$2,500'
    - '&7Effects:'
    - ' &c• Strength II (1:30)'
    - ' &b• Speed II (3:00)'
    - ' &6• Fire Resistance (5:00)'
```

*Note*:
- `amplifier: 0` = Level 1 effect (e.g. Strength I, Speed I).
- `amplifier: 1` = Level 2 effect (e.g. Strength II, Speed II).
- `duration: 20` = 1 second (e.g. `1800` ticks = 90 seconds / 1:30 min).

---

#### Method 2: Standard Vanilla Splash Potions (`POTION_TYPE:`)

For single-effect vanilla potions, specify the `POTION_TYPE` key:
```yaml
SPLASH-STRENGTH-POTION:
  CURRENCY: MONEY
  MATERIAL: SPLASH_POTION
  POTION_TYPE: STRONG_STRENGTH  # Options: STRENGTH, STRONG_STRENGTH (Strength II), LONG_STRENGTH (Strength 8:00)
  DISPLAY-NAME: '&cSplash Potion of Strength II'
  SLOT: 12
  PRICE-PER-UNIT: 500.0
  LORE:
    - '&fBuy price: &a$500'
```

#### Step-by-Step Setup Guide:
1. Open `plugins/UltimateDonutSmp/shop.yml`.
2. Locate your target menu section (e.g., `GEAR-MENU` or create a new `POTION-MENU`).
3. Paste the potion configuration entry into the `ITEMS:` section.
4. Save `shop.yml` and run `/uds reload` in-game or from console.
